All I know is that I clearly did not take my ADHD medicine this morning, because I immediately become distracted and forget about the duel for about ten seconds, but then I remember "Oh, right, $100,000" and go in for the kill.', 'Hello, everyone. Technoblade here. If you\'re watching this, I am dead. So let\'s sit down, and have one final chat. My real name is Alex. I had one of my siblings call me Dave one time in a deleted video from 2016, and it was one of the most successful pranks we\'ve ever done. Thousands of creepy online dudes trying to get overly personal, going, \'Oh, hey, Dave, how\'s it going?\' Sorry for selling out so much in the past year, but thanks to everyone that bought hoodies, plushies, and channel memberships. My siblings are goin\' to collegeâ€”well, if they want to. I don\'t wanna put any dead-brother peer pressure on them. But that\'s all from me. Thank you all for supporting my content over the years. If I had another hundred lives, I think I would choose to be Technoblade again every single time, as those were the happiest years of my life. I hope you guys enjoyed my content, and that I made some of you laugh. And I hope you all go on to live long, prosperous, and happy lives. Because I love you guys.
